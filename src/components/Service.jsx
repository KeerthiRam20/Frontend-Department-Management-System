            <p>HOME PAGE CONTENT MUST ADD VALUE. While planning your home page, 
                pay attention to all the aspects of design, graphics, 
                and most importantly, the content. Do not waste critical 
                space on your homepage by adding unrelated images and long,
                 looped Flash banners that do little for your web presence.
